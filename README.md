# The tracebase data set

The tracebase data set is a collection of power consumption traces which can be used in energy analytics research. Traces have been collected from individual electrical appliances, at an average reporting rate of one sample per second.

# Trace format

The collected readings are stored in comma-separated value files; one file is created for each metered wall outlet. Files are grouped into directories according to the type of the appliance that has been monitored. Each entry in the file contains the date and time of its collection and the power consumption readings averaged over time durations of one and eight seconds, respectively. The timestamp field follows the "day/month/year hour:minute:second" format, in which the time is specified using a 24-hour notation. An excerpt of a trace looks as follows:

```
14/01/2012 10:48:47; 151; 156
14/01/2012 10:48:48; 147; 151
14/01/2012 10:48:49; 147; 151
14/01/2012 10:48:50; 145; 149
14/01/2012 10:48:51; 145; 147
14/01/2012 10:48:52; 145; 147
14/01/2012 10:48:53; 143; 147
14/01/2012 10:48:54; 143; 145
14/01/2012 10:48:55; 143; 143
```

# Trace files

The tracebase data set contains power traces of a variety of electric appliances. Traces are clustered into directories according to their collection process.


### Full-day traces

The "complete" directory contains traces which were recorded over a period of 24 hours. Each trace starts at midnight and ends at midnight the next day. The smart plug was not disconnected during this period even if the device had been switched off.

### Incomplete traces

This archive contains traces where measurement points are missing from the recorded data. This is mostly due to problems with the collection setup and/or the wireless transmission of the meter readings. No interpolation has been applied to traces in the "incomplete" folder. 

### Synthetic traces

The "synthetic" archive contains trace fragments of real appliances, which have been padded with zero consumption readings. The traces have been collected as follows: An appliance, e.g., a vacuum cleaner, has been connected
to the metering device at some point during the day (the usage time reflects the time during which the user wanted to use the vacuum cleaner) and was operated as usual. After it had been used, it was disconnected from the metering device. The resulting CSV file was thus composed of an incomplete daily trace, lacking both the periods before and after the usage of the appliance. These missing timeframes were artificially padded with zero consumption readings in order to attain a complete daily trace.
